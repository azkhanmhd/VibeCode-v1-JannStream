- Streams video using **HTTP range requests** for instant playback.
- Single-page web interface to **paste URL and play** videos.
- Optimized for **terminal and cloud environments**.
- Supports **large video files** without long initial load.

```

---

3. The video will download once, then stream in chunks.

## Notes

- **Designed for cloud environments**: Works best on terminal-based servers (Google Cloud Console, AWS EC2, etc.).
- **Disk space**: Ensure your environment has enough space for large video files.
- **Persistence**: On serverless platforms (like Google Cloud Run), local storage may be ephemeral. For permanent storage, consider integrating with **Google Cloud Storage**.
